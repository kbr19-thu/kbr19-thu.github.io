I am a PhD student in Department of [Electrical and Computer Engineering, CDE](https://cde.nus.edu.sg/ece/), [National University of Singapore](https://www.nus.edu.sg). Before that, I worked as a research intern (RA) supervised by Prof. [Jiaying Liu](http://39.96.165.147/people/liujiaying.html) in [Wangxuan Institute of Computer Technology](https://www.icst.pku.edu.cn/index.htm), [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn). My research interests mainly include medical image processing, general computer vision, AI for healthcare & Science and other deep learning techniques. I received the B.Eng. degree in Civil Engineering from [School of Civil Engineering](https://www.civil.tsinghua.edu.cn/), awarded **Excellent Graduate (优良毕业生)** of [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn) in June 2023, supervised by Prof. [Chen GU](http://erlweb.mit.edu/users/guchchmitedu), an MIT alumnus.  Due to my unusual experiences mentioned above, I also have a certain interest in disaster prevention and mitigation, as well as AI for science.

<!-- After that, I continued to pursue a PhD degree mainly in AI for seismology supervised by Chen in Institute of Disaster Prevention and Mitigation Engineering (IDPME), and quited in January 2024. -->
